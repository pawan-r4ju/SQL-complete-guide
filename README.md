## Prerequisites

- **Relational Model:** Defined by Edgar Codd, it establishes rules for structuring databases using tables (relations) with unique keys and relationships.
- **Normalization:** A process that organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. It involves Normal Forms like 1NF (eliminate duplicate columns), 2NF (remove partial dependencies), and 3NF (eliminate transitive dependencies).
- **ACID Properties:** Essential for database transactions to ensure reliability:
  - **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.
  - **Consistency:** Ensures data validity before and after transactions.
  - **Isolation:** Transactions operate independently.
  - **Durability:** Committed transactions are permanent.
- **ER Diagrams:** Visual representations of database structures, showing entities (tables), relationships (associations between tables), and cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.).

## Learn basics of DBMS
> **Note:** Before diving into the basics of SQL, make sure you have theoretical knowledge of the prerequisites.
